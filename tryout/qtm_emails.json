Information on our programs can be found here. For detailed information on program requirements and courses, please see our Graduate Student Handbook. \n \nThe 36-credit MA in Gerontology leads to stable employment for our graduates, who go on to serve older adults through employment in direct service, governmental, and non-governmental organizations.  Approximately one-fourth go on to earn PhDs in Gerontology, Sociology, and other related fields. \n \nWe admit students for the MA program once a year to begin in the Fall term. The deadline for Fall 2025 MA applications is March 1.  We admit Certificate students in both Fall and Spring terms. The deadlines for  Certificate applications is July 1 (for Fall) and November 15 (for Spring).\n \nWe offer a few graduate assistantships each year to MA students; these include a tuition waiver and a small stipend ($7200) across the year in exchange for working 8 hours/week with a professor. We do not offer Graduate Assistantships to Certificate students. \n \nThe application is comprised of: a brief statement of interest (wherein applicants describe why they want to pursue a certificate or MA in Gerontology, their passion for the field, and/or their research interests), three letters of reference, and transcripts. We do not require the GRE. You may begin your application here. \n \nOur 18-credit Certificate program offers a specialized credential in Gerontology for professionals or graduate students in other fields. This program typically takes one year to complete.  \n \nOur 9-credit Certificate in Leadership and Aging is designed for people who are already working in the field in some way, who would like to gain knowledge in the field as well as a credential.\n \nAll credits earned in our Certificate programs may be applied to our MA degree.\n \nInterested students are welcome to contact me directly with questions about the programs or the application process:  wsimonds@gsu.edu.\n \n \n \n \nDATA CAMP RENEWAL\n \nHaving challenges opening the data camp link? \n \nIt has been updated!\n                                                                                                                                                                  \nIt is active from 11/13/2024-05/13/2025 see links below\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n \nPrerequisites\nYou must complete ALL prerequisites listed in order to enroll in these courses.\nQTM 210\n\t•\tEither QTM 120 or MATH 210 or MATH 211\nQTM 220\n\t•\tQTM 110\n\t•\tQTM 150\n\t•\tQTM 210 or ECON 220 or MATH 361 with a plan to co-enroll in MATH 362\n\t•\tMATH 210 or MATH 211\n\t•\tMATH 221\nElective Prerequisites\n\t•\tQTM 385 prerequisites will be listed in the course description!!!\n \nEquivalents\nBelow are courses that act as equivalents to the respective QTM courses\nQTM 210:\n\t•\tECON 220 and [MATH 210 or MATH 211]\n\t•\tOR - MATH 362\nQTM 220:\n\t•\tECON 320 plus QTM 110, QTM 150, MATH 221 and [MATH 210 or MATH 211]\n \nFor General Academic Advising\nSchedule an appointment at https://calendly.com/emoryqtm.\n \nIf you have any questions regarding the above information, please do not hesitate to reach out.\n \nBest,\nSadie Hannans\nQTM Program Coordinator\nShanna9@emory.edu   470-620-7981\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n   \n \n     \n\n   \n\n\n\n\nPROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nQTM Preparation: A Pathway to Professionalism\n \nNew Resources Available\n\n \n Getting Started with SQL\n\n \nGit and GitHub\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nQTM DataCamp Access\nQTM Access to DataCamp is now back in business!

    "content": "SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT\n \nEmory's Center for AI Learning is now accepting applications to participate in the Spring 2025 AI. Data Lab program!\n \nAI.Data Lab is a 10 week, data micro-consulting project hosted by the Center for AI Learning where students will work in teams to solve real-world problems with data. Each team will gain exposure to the world of professional data analytics by tackling issues presented by companies in the Atlanta area and developing data-driven solutions for them. \nFor this iteration, students will have the opportunity to work with the following organizations:\n\t•\tTechBridge (TB): TB is a non-profit whose mission is to alleviate generational poverty by equipping other non-profits with enterprise-grade software and technology. Students will investigate and leverage over 18+ years of transactional national data to improve the foundational algorithm for TB's flagship software addressing hunger relief.\n\t•\tSustainability Office (SO): The Emory Sustainability Office is interested in invoking sustainability into AI practices. This project will task students to creatively brainstorm how to approach either better understanding energy usage of AI, how to inform users of their individual AI tool behaviors' impact on energy, and/or how Emory could measure and report on sustainable AI practices.\n\t•\tEmory Department of Chemistry (C): Over the last 10 years, the Department of Chemistry has revamped its curriculum to improve the experience of Chemistry majors. After collecting a large amount of evaluation and survey data, this AI.Data Lab project will analyze the success of the curriculum overhaul and pitch how the department can continue to improve. \n\t•\tInvestAtlanta (IA): IA is a local government authority for Atlanta focused on the economic and equitable improvement of the city. Students will conduct a sentiment analysis of governmental-adjacent agencies, like InvestAtlanta, to understand public perception of agencies that work in this industry.\nStudents with all kinds of experience levels are encouraged to apply. However, selected students will be expected to be able to work with Python in order to perform analysis. Teams will be created in such a way to induce the greatest experiential diversity within each team as to allow those with less experience to learn from students with more background in programming. Undergraduate students are eligible to receive 1 credit hour in INTERN496R to achieve their Experience & Application (XA) credit for their participation.\nAll participants in the AI.Data Lab program will be expected to attend weekly meetings on Thursdays from 6:00 - 7:30 in White Hall. These meetings are meant to provide students with a common time and location to work with their teams.  Topics can range from soft skills, such as data storytelling, to hard skills like string processing. Therefore, students applying must have this block of time free in their weekly schedule -- at least two-thirds of these weekly meetings must be attended to earn a Pass/Satisfactory grade, and/or to be credited in final deliverables. If this time does not work for you, AI.Data Lab will be offered in subsequent semesters and you are encouraged to apply for later iterations.\n \nApplications are due by 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday, January 21. The first weekly meeting will take place at 6:00PM on January 30th. If you have any questions, please reach out to tottoli@emory.edu.\n \nThe application can be found here: https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=nPsE4KSwT0K80DImBtXfONoMV0zVh_FDuG1Bf6CV029UNzhRNFUwMUM2SUxOSzhYSDBBVDYxSk9OUC4u.\n \n \nSadie Hannans\nUndergraduate Program Coordinator\nDepartment of Quantitative Theory & Methods\nEmory University\nEmail: shanna9@emory.edu | 470-620-7981\n(she/her/hers)"

The fellowships will commence in July 2025, and they are 2 years in duration. Students can find further details here. \nAttached, please find a brochure describing the fellowships. Please feel free to print the brochure and post it in your department. I ask that you let us know that you have received this e-mail and that you forward it, along with the associated brochure, to students in the Department of Quantitative Theory and Methods. \nThe Cohen Fellowship in Developmental Social Neuroscience will involve cutting-edge social neuroscience and/or neuroimaging research in infants, toddlers and adolescents. Fellows will work to further the understanding of autism through eye-tracking research, guiding a project from the point of data collection to publication of results. \nThe Simons Fellowship in Computational Neuroscience will involve integrating computational strategies with clinical research goals. Fellows will develop methods for the analysis of visual scanning and eye-tracking data, computational models of visual salience, and data visualization techniques, all with the aim of advancing the understanding of autism and efforts at early diagnosis. \nThe Louise and Brett Samsky Fellowship in Educational Science and Practice will involve research in educational innovations in autism. Fellows will learn about classroom-based interventions to increase social emotional engagement and inclusion, gaining experiences with observational research methods, practical experience through direct classroom responsibilities, cutting edge intervention research, and implementation science approaches. \nThe Sally Provence Fellowship in Clinical Research will select fellows for a two-year training in clinical assessment measures and research methodologies to better understand ASD and related disabilities. \nThe ACCESS Fellowship in Implementation Science will select fellows for a two-year training in research focused on community engagement participatory methods, translating evidence-based treatments for autism into community settings, as well as the processes and partnerships that support these efforts. \nThank you for your help! We look forward to hearing from you. \nSincerely, Marcus Predoctoral Fellowship Committee \n\nMarcus Autism Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, & Emory University School of Medicine Phone: 404-785-9554 Email: marcus.predoc-fellowships@emory.edu \n \nSee attached flyer\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n \nPrerequisites\nYou must complete ALL prerequisites listed in order to enroll in these courses.\nQTM 210\n\t•\tEither QTM 120 or MATH 210 or MATH 211\nQTM 220\n\t•\tQTM 110\n\t•\tQTM 150\n\t•\tQTM 210 or ECON 220 or MATH 361 with a plan to co-enroll in MATH 362\n\t•\tMATH 210 or MATH 211\n\t•\tMATH 221\nElective Prerequisites\n\t•\tQTM 385 prerequisites will be listed in the course description!!!\n \nEquivalents\nBelow are courses that act as equivalents to the respective QTM courses\nQTM 210:\n\t•\tECON 220 and [MATH 210 or MATH 211]\n\t•\tOR - MATH 362\nQTM 220:\n\t•\tECON 320 plus QTM 110, QTM 150, MATH 221 and [MATH 210 or MATH 211]\n \nFor General Academic Advising\nSchedule an appointment at https://calendly.com/emoryqtm.\n \nIf you have any questions regarding the above information, please do not hesitate to reach out.\n \nBest,\nSadie Hannans\nQTM Program Coordinator\nShanna9@emory.edu   470-620-7981\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n   \n \n     \n\n   \n\n\n\n\nPROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nQTM Preparation: A Pathway to Professionalism\n \nNew Resources Available\n\n \n Getting Started with SQL\n\n \nGit and GitHub\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nQTM DataCamp Access\nQTM Access to DataCamp is now back in business!

A limited number of full scholarship opportunities will be available on a case-by-case basis. Please contact Amanda Miller for more information.\n \nWe would greatly appreciate any help you could provide to promote this event to staff, students, faculty, and community members who may be interested. \n \nI’ve attached graphics and have included additional information below. Please let me know if you have any questions, and thank you in advance for your review.\n \n \nFoundations of AI: AI for Non-Coders | September 26 at 1 PM ET\nEver say to yourself: what even is an LLM? How do I get from chatting with ChatGPT to talking about larger AI products? How do I answer these nonstop questions from colleagues, customers, leadership and more in this new landscape? Do you find yourself needing expertise on AI that, quite frankly, you didn’t sign up for? This course is designed to meet the needs of people who are not necessarily well-versed in math and science but who know that they need to know the basics about AI in this changing landscape. You’ll learn about what AI can accomplish, the intuitions behind how it works (no math or coding necessary!), and opportunities and risks. You’ll come away feeling confident that you know not only what an LLM actually is, but understand all the jargon people use to talk about it. Scholarships are available on a case-by-case basis.\n \nThose interested in the event can register directly at this link: https://bit.ly/AI_NonCoders_NCDS. \n \n \n \nSadie Hannans\nUndergraduate Program Coordinator\nDepartment of Quantitative Theory & Methods\nEmory University\nEmail: shanna9@emory.edu | 470-620-7981\n(she/her/hers)"

We support interdisciplinary research that explores the impact of Black thought on social justice movements and contemporary debates, ensuring that cultural expressions are accessible for future scholarship and public engagement.\n \nWe offer training programs for Black students from the Atlanta metro area and HBCUs, equipping them with skills in coding, digital humanities, AI, and LLMs, preparing them for leadership in academia, technology, and public history.\n \nA key focus of our work is extracting \"thick data\" from archival research and ethnographic studies to inform the design of AI systems and the development of Black-centered datasets and ethical AI frameworks.\n \nOur Risk-Informed Design Pipeline identifies and addresses potential harms in AI development, ensuring that AI models are accurate and socially responsible. We also develop and curate datasets that reflect Black experiences, contributing to the creation of fair and robust AI models.\n \nSignature projects include the Atlanta Black Philosophy, Theology, and Art Archive, the Thick Data Collection Initiative, Black-Centered Algorithmic Fairness, and Mapping Black Atlanta, an interactive digital map of significant sites in the city’s Black history.\n \nPlease share this with any interested students.

We will focus on prediction---using data we have to tell us something about data we don't, statistical inference---characterizing the uncertainty we have about the accuracy of these predictions, and causal inference---understanding what the relationships we see in the data tell us about the impact of actions we might take. While the class will emphasize the intuitive and mathematical foundations of these concepts, we will also cover the implementation of these techniques in applications using the statistical programming language R.\n \nTo succeed in this course, students should have the same prerequisites as for QTM 220: (QTM 110 or QTM_OX 110) & (QTM 150 or QTM_OX 150) & (QTM 120 or MATH 210 or MATH_OX 210 or MATH_211 or MATH_OX 211) & [QTM 210 or QTM_OX 210 or ECON 220 or ECON_OX 220 or (MATH 361 and MATH 362)] & (MATH 221 or MATH_OX 221) or equivalent.\n \n \nSadie Hannans\nUndergraduate Program Coordinator\nDepartment of Quantitative Theory & Methods\nEmory University\nEmail: shanna9@emory.edu | 470-620-7981\n(she/her/hers)"

The focus of this symposium is to collaboratively uncover bias, establish collaborations, and provide the opportunity to work with real data, supported by a team that understands the data. Following the success of last year’s event (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzXoOyKlOtg), we have observed the need to bridge the communication gap between medical professionals and computer scientists. Therefore, we are dedicating four days to summarizing the common mistakes and pitfalls we have observed, using a case-based approach to learning medical imaging. \n   \nDuring these four days, we will offer a case-based learning curriculum that spans from ICU data to Chest X-ray, as well as breast imaging data. We will also be launching EMBED2, a multi-modal breast imaging data, including 3D imaging (tomosynthesis) and MRI imaging, with improved patient outcomes.  \n  \nWe hope you can join us.

Our yearlong program has prepared recent college graduates for 30 years to launch a career in environmental  organizing and advocacy by providing hands-on experience running campaigns with groups like the Wilderness Society, Endangered Species Coalition, Mighty Earth and more. We then connect our graduates to jobs in the environmental and social change movement.\n \nGreen Corps Organizer Program - The Field School for Environmental Organizing\nGreen Corps is looking for college graduates who are ready to take on the biggest environmental challenges of our day.\nLearn more and apply on our website!\n \nThe planet needs all the help it can get. To win now and build a strong foundation for lasting progress, we need people who know how to organize: to run organizations and campaigns that will inspire the support and action we need to save our environment. Our program starts with intensive classroom training. You learn about issues and campaigns, organizing theory and principles, and skills from recruiting volunteers to staging a media event. Then, you move to a more hands-on experience. You make a difference on important campaigns to transition our country to clean energy, protect wildlife, and more. For example, Lauren Karpinski, an organizer from the Green Corps Class of 2019, brought together a coalition of 40 groups that helped win a landmark solar energy bill in Arkansas.\n \nWe’re accepting the top 20 candidates for our 2024-2025 program. Graduates will join our more than 400 alumni who are leading environmental campaigns and organizations across the country. If you’re passionate about the environment and ready to learn and practice the craft of organizing after graduation, apply today!\n \nNot a graduating senior? Add your name to our list to receive updates about Green Corps including summer internships and jobs in the environmental and broader social change field!\n \nGreen Corps’ year-long program begins in August 2024 with introductory classroom training, and continues with field placements in multiple locations across the U.S. Candidates must be willing to relocate. Please contact Margaret Corcoran at margaret@greencorps.org with additional questions.\n \nGreen Corps is part of The Public Interest Network, which operates and supports organizations committed to a shared vision of a better world and a  strategic approach to social change. Visit publicinterestnetwork.org to learn more. Green Corps is an equal opportunity employer. The target annual compensation for this position is $32,500 (but compensation may range between $32,500 and $39,000 depending on location). Green Corps' benefits package includes medical insurance for employees and dependents, needs-based student loan assistance, commuter benefit program, sick pay (60-72 hours/year depending on location), and 80 hours (2 weeks) of accrued vacation.

Led by Sarah McPhee, Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Art History, the round-table will include ECDS staff Joanna Mundy, Ian Burr, and John Halbert, and artist Nicole Costello Matthews. The team will discuss the research, modeling, texturing, and animation of Baroque Rome, and you will have an opportunity to explore the newest version of the 3D city yourself!\n \nLearn about the recent research in the project and stroll the streets of Rome with Giovanni Battista Falda.\n \nWe hope that you are able to attend.

    "content": "SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT FROM DR. KEVIN MCALISTER, QTM DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH\n \nDataThink is a 10-week data micro-consulting project hosted by the QTM Department and Center for Artificial Intelligence Learning where students will work in teams to solve real problems with real data. Each team will learn the context of the problem and develop a data-driven solution. Participants will gain exposure to the world of professional data analytics, working on projects very similar to those that analysts would in their day-to-day work.\nEach team of 5 will be working with data from the Better Business Bureau (BBB) to develop insights to understand how to better communicate with businesses (particularly women and black-owned businesses) that do not currently take advantage of the BBB's local business credibility services. Teams will work together to develop an analysis given the research question to be presented as a poster at the DataThink end of year showcase with the best projects (as judged by a panel of data scientists from around the Atlanta community) receiving a best-in-show award and having the teams' names placed on a plaque.  Students will also prepare a 3-minute lightning talk to describe their work and conclusions that will be presented to the BBB.  The end-of-semester showcase and presentations will be an excellent opportunity to meet with data scientists from around Emory's campus and in the Atlanta community at large.Beginning this semester, all participants in the DataThink program will be expected to attend weekly meetings on Tuesdays from 5:30 - 6:45 in PAIS 290.  The goal of these meetings is to provide students with a common time and place to meet with their teams and discuss how their analysis can progress.  Additionally, each weekly meeting will begin with a 20-minute lecture on an important topic in data science that you may or may not have covered in any of your previous classes.  Topics will include developing meaningful summary tables, string processing, joining multiple data sources using SQL syntax, effectively designing a project poster, etc.To be allowed at the end of semester event, students must attend at least two-thirds of these weekly meetings.  Attendance will be checked via QR code.  As such, it is expected that students applying to participate in this program will have this block of time free in their weekly schedule.  If this time does not work for you, know that the DataThink program will be offered each semester and you are more than welcome to apply in later semesters.  Students with all kinds of experience levels are encouraged to apply. However, selected students will be expected to be able to work with Python in order to perform analysis.  Teams will be created in such a way to induce the greatest experiential diversity within each team as to allow those with less experience to learn from students with more background in programming.   Selected students will gain experience in the following areas:\n\t•\tData Storytelling\n\t•\tInsight development for a real client\n\t•\tProfessional experience to build one’s resume\n\t•\tIn-demand data technical skills such as Python, SQL, and data visualization tools\n\t•\tCollaboration and teamwork in the data space\nTo be considered, please have your application in by 5:00 PM on Wednesday, January 31st.  The application can be found at https://forms.office.com/r/NaVXn8Q0T8.  If the embedded hyperlink does not work, please copy and paste this address into your browser: https://forms.office.com/r/NaVXn8Q0T8\n \nThe first weekly meeting will take place at 5:30 on February 6th.  \n \nIf you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to Kevin McAlister at kevin.mcalister@emory.edu.\n \n \n \nSadie Hannans\nUndergraduate Program Coordinator\nDepartment of Quantitative Theory & Methods\nEmory University\nEmail: shanna9@emory.edu | 470-620-7981\n(she/her/hers)"

Survival data from clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of therapies in a cancer subtype may be limited. You will explore use of other sources of data; based on alternative outcomes, study types or other cancers, which may need to be synthesised efficiently for reliable policy decisions. \nYou will apply a range of modern tools from biostatistics (including Bayesian statistics, meta-analysis and survival analysis), epidemiology and data science and develop novel approaches for evaluation of cancer therapies.\nThis project is part of an exciting collaboration with University of Birmingham and AstraZeneca. You will benefit from an experienced supervisory team with expertise in statistics and oncology and an industry partner.

Bromberg.  3 credits\nWhat this course IS:\nThis course is designed to introduce biologists and computer scientists to basic bioinformatics concepts, principles, and techniques within the framework of command-line and web-based databases/tools.\nStudents that take the course are expected to:\n1.     Know how to work in a command-line environment and have a basic understanding of programming/scripting. The course includes a brief introduction to writing Python scripts but requires prior understanding of programming concepts.\n2.     Have a working understanding of general biology, evolution, biochemistry, and genetics concepts. The course includes only brief summaries of the necessary bio concepts and requires pre-existing knowledge.\nBy the end of this course, students will possess a bioinformatics skill set, including an informed vocabulary and knowledge of basic script development, sufficient for a productive collaboration within a multi-disciplined research team.\n \nWhat this course IS NOT:\nThis is NOT an applied methods course; rather, this class is aimed at understanding of underlying algorithms. We will NOT attempt to list all available tools or teach you how to use them. Method selection, along with the corresponding cutoffs, thresholds, and settings, is specific to each and every research project. If you keep up with the class material you will understand the method underpinnings and be able to able to optimize your project choices on your own.\n \nThis intro course is also NOT intended for advanced computer science students looking to develop algorithmic expertise in bioinformatics.\n \nCourse Objectives\n1.     Teach students to cast a biology problem as a bioinformatic problem, provide them with the skills necessary to independently select relevant tools, optimize their settings, and build pipelines to solve the set problem.\n2.     Introduce students to the current bioinformatics algorithms/concepts and their implementations and prepare them for more advanced bioinformatics courses.\n3.     Teach students a sufficient bioinformatics skill set, including an informed vocabulary and knowledge of basic script development, for productive collaboration within a multi-disciplined research team.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat do YOU want to learn?\nThe Emory Center for Digital Scholarship wants to know your thoughts!

JO GULDI\n \n \nQTM 490R: Research Lab\n“Using AI to Assess the Documentary History of Climate Change: A Multidisciplinary Approach”\n \nAs carbon and methane emissions shape our shared future, one essential question is how organizations, institutions, and markets are adopting or failing to adopt new regulations and practices for carbon mitigation and adaptation. An enormous number of published texts document the regulatory life of organizations involved with climate change, including the publications the United Nations, the quarterly reports of U.S Corporations, the World Bank Reports, the Building Codes that govern city, county, and state sustainability plans, and the bills passed by nations. \n \nTo date, few scholars have attempted to deploy AI to inspect this documentary record.  As a result, we have little insight into the successes, failures, and promise of initiatives represented by this documentary base. Research in Computer Science by specialists in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the Digital Humanities (DH), however, hold promising keys for moving from large language models to accurate depictions of historical change in the recent past.\n \nOur research will apply these new methods to understanding contemporary institutions. We will connect modern white-box methods from Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Digital Humanities (DH) to the data of climate change governance, illuminating the history of official promises and regulation attempts, and allowing researchers to assemble a timeline and critical account of how climate governance has been changing over the past five, ten, and twenty years.  \n \nWhat will the course be like? In a research lab, we don’t have a set syllabus as in a seminar or lecture series. In lab meetings, student teams plan ambitious projects of understanding, hear from invited experts, plan to seek out specialty knowledge around campus, and present their results for group review.  Readings are assigned as students require input to direct their work on a series of interrelated research problems that they work on in teams. The result is that every student participates actively in shaping their own research agenda, with guidance from the professor and other students.\n \nWhat will I study? Current research projects include these topics:\n-                      The historical analysis of text over time, showing the evolution of political promises, regulation, commodities trends, and technological adaptation across different nations and markets \n-                      Legal issues about corporate and state responsibility  \n-                      Sociological and historical questions about the evolution of institutions and promises in Brazil, Tanzania and Ethiopia and other developing nations, as well as issues about the inclusion of indigenous property rights and political participation \n-                      Statistical inference about relationships between text-based promises and quantitative data on climate change, for instance, electricity bills, satellite data showing rainforest cover,  georeferenced carbon emissions, and data about human displacement and conflict, so as to determine where political and corporate promises have been realized \n \nWhat data will I be working with? Databases we are being assembled by students involved with Guldi Lab include these:\n\t•\tThe documentary publications of the UN regarding REDD, the governance framework for assessing rainforest governance\n\t•\tEDGAR, quarterly reports of U.S. publicly-listed corporations discussing their investments in climate mitigation technologies as well as their interest in a shifting profile of agricultural products\n\t•\tThe MEDIACLOUD database of news stories from major cities as well as the developing world\n\t•\tThe reports of the WORLD BANK that govern major investments in the developing world\n\t•\tMUNICODE, a database of building codes from American cities, counties, and states which govern the standard of sustainability to which new buildings must be built\n\t•\tThe CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, the annals of debate in the U.S. Congress \n \nWhat does it mean to take a multidisciplinary approach to climate governance?

Each team is led by a professional mentor who will explain the context of the problem and help guide the team through developing a solution. Participants will gain exposure to the world of professional data analytics, working on projects very similar to those that analysts would in their day-to-day work.Students with all kinds of experience levels are encouraged to apply - the DataThink program is intended as an introduction to real-world data science projects!   That said, selected students will be expected to be able to work with Python (or have a willingness to learn to do so) in order to perform analysis.  Above all else, we're looking for students who are passionate about data science and are eager to learn new skills and apply them to real-world problems.Please only apply for the DataThink program if you have the availability to commit roughly 3-4 hours per week over the entire 11 week program to the project.  DataThink projects typically have the same workload as a 1 credit hour class (which is to say, more work than just showing up but nowhere near that of a full 3 credit hour class).  The quality of the final deliverable and the experience for the other students on your team are contingent on your continued participation, so please be sure that you'll be able to fit this work into your schedule.Selected students will gain experience in the following areas:•       Data Storytelling•       Insight development for a real client•       Professional experience to build one’s resume•       In-demand data technical skills such as Python, SQL, and data visualization tools•       Collaboration and teamwork in the data spaceThis semester we are proud to partner on projects with the following organizations:•       Science for Georgia•       Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta•       Better Business Bureau (Atlanta & NE Georgia)•       Enterprise Community Partners\nInterested student should submit their application here by end of day on Friday, September 8th.  If the embedded link does not work, you can access the application by pasting https://forms.office.com/r/wWRcQUydkx into your browser.  Students will be informed of their application status soon after this deadline.\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to Dr. Kevin McAlister (kevin.mcalister@emory.edu) or Scott Parent (sparent@emory.edu).\n \n \n \nSadie Hannans\nUndergraduate Program Coordinator\nDepartment of Quantitative Theory & Methods\nEmory University\nEmail: shanna9@emory.edu | 470-620-7981\n(she/her/hers)"

Each team is led by a professional mentor who will explain the context of the problem and help guide the team through developing a solution. Participants will gain exposure to the world of professional data analytics, working on projects very similar to those that analysts would in their day-to-day work.\n \nStudents with all kinds of experience levels are encouraged to apply - the DataThink program is intended as an introduction to real-world data science projects!   That said, selected students will be expected to be able to work with Python (or have a willingness to learn to do so) in order to perform analysis.  Above all else, we're looking for students who are passionate about data science and are eager to learn new skills and apply them to real-world problems. \n \nPlease only apply for the DataThink program if you have the availability to commit roughly 3-4 hours per week over the entire 11 week program to the project.  DataThink projects typically have the same workload as a 1 credit hour class (which is to say, more work than just showing up but nowhere near that of a full 3 credit hour class).  The quality of the final deliverable and the experience for the other students on your team are contingent on your continued participation, so please be sure that you'll be able to fit this work into your schedule.\n \nSelected students will gain experience in the following areas:\n·        Data Storytelling\n·        Insight development for a real client\n·        Professional experience to build one’s resume\n·        In-demand data technical skills such as Python, SQL, and data visualization tools\n·        Collaboration and teamwork in the data space\nThis semester we are proud to partner on projects with the following organizations:\n·        Science for Georgia\n·        Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta\n·        Better Business Bureau (Atlanta & NE Georgia)\n·        Enterprise Community Partners\nInterested student should submit their application https://forms.office.com/r/wWRcQUydkx. by end of day on Friday, September 8th.  Students will be informed of their application status soon after this deadline.\n \nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to Dr. Kevin McAlister (kevin.mcalister@emory.edu) or Scott Parent (sparent@emory.edu).\n \n________________________________________________________\n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Opportunity \n \n \n      \n   Microsoft Mock Interview + LinkedIn Workshop \nTuesday, September 26, 2023 \n1:00-5:00 PM \nIn-Person at Microsoft Atlanta \n170 17th St NW, Atlanta, GA 30363 \n \nAre you a student seeking guidance on how to prepare for interviews and optimize your LinkedIn profile?\nIf so, this workshop is perfect for you! \n Experienced Microsoft professionals will help hone your interview skills and LinkedIn profile. During this event, you will practice answering real interview questions and receive personalized feedback.\n \nYou'll get to participate in a 1-on-1 mock interview in one of the following disciplines: \n·        AI & ML \n·        Basic & Applied Research \n·        Business & Finance \n·        Content Design & Technical Writing \n·        Data & Applied Science \n·        Product Design \n·        Product & Program Management \n·        Software Engineering \n·        User Experience Research \n \nIn addition to the mock interviews, you'll have the chance to receive LinkedIn profile feedback from a LinkedIn professional to help you optimize your profile and showcase your skills and experience to potential employers. \n \nThe event will include lunch, professional headshots, networking, and opportunities to learn about real Microsoft projects.

We work with nonprofits across the world, in areas like clean energy, gender equality, and healthcare, on projects relating to strategy, tech, marketing, and expansion.One of 180's goals this year is to increase our non-business school members. While consulting is often associated with business, we firmly believe that students from the College of Arts and Sciences bring unique skillsets and perspectives to the table. In fact, 180's current and past exec board has had students studying Economics, Human Health, Math, and even French. This is why we wish to reach out to and encourage QTM students to apply. \n180 isn't looking for business-ready consultants: we want students who are creative, critical thinkers, and passionate about social impact. On Tuesday, September 5th, at 5:30pm, we will be hosting an info session specifically for college students at White Hall, room 103. In this session, we'll be demystifying consulting for non-BBA students. \nAgain, 180 would truly love to have students of \"nontraditional\" majors join the club.\n                                \nSubmitted by Carolyn Han, Emory University - Goizueta Business School                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSpecial message for QSS Majors with Biology Track \n \n \nQSS-BIO majors: we are starting a mailing list specific to this growing QSS track, to make it easier to discuss issues and post messages that are QSS-BIO specific.

    "content": "SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT \n \n \n \nThe QTM department is now accepting applications for QTM undergraduate research fellows for the Fall 2023 semester.\n \nThe goal of the QTM fellows program is to introduce students to the wide array of research opportunities that exist across curricular areas that leverage the skills that they learn in their QTM classes.  As a student researcher, you will have the opportunity to assist in a faculty-led research project and receive mentorship regarding graduate school and career opportunities.  Historically, students who work with a faculty member for one semester choose to extend their time on the project beyond the first semester which leads to long-term research collaborations.\nStudents who participate in the QTM fellows program will be enrolled in a 3 credit hour research class (QTM 499R).  This means that you can expect to commit roughly 10 hours per week (on average) to research activities.  The requirements for this class are simply to work with a faculty mentor on research activities.  To monitor student participation and progress, your faculty mentors will be asked to fill out two quick surveys (one at midterm time and one at the end of the semester) to rate your performance up until that point.  Grades will be given as a function of the responses to these surveys and a short written summary of your research work turned in at the end of the semester.\n \nStudents who would like to apply for a QTM fellowship should fill out one of the two applications below: \n \n\t•\tIf you already have a faculty advisor from any department across Emory’s campus who has committed to serve as your research advisor for the semester, fill out this application. \n\t•\tIf you would like to be placed in the pool of students to be matched with a faculty advisor looking for an undergraduate research assistant, fill out this application. \n \nApplicants who already have a committed research advisor should submit their application no less than 3 days before the end of the add/drop/swap period in the semester.  Applications submitted after this time will be rejected and you will not be enrolled in QTM 499R.  This application requires a signed and dated letter from the faculty advisor stating that they are willing to serve in this capacity for the semester.  Applications that do not include this letter will not be reviewed and you will not be allowed to enroll in the research course for credit.  Upon completion of the application, the letter will be reviewed and the Director of Undergraduate Research will choose whether or not to approve enrollment in QTM 499R.  Students will be informed of the status of their applications as soon as possible. \n \nApplicants who are applying to be placed in the pool of research assistants that will be matched with faculty advisors should complete the application close to the beginning of each semester.  Applications will be reviewed and matched on a rolling basis with the first wave of matches occurring on the first Friday of classes in the new semester.  Further applications will be reviewed and matched, as possible, until the end of the semester’s add/drop/swap period. \n \nWhen matching students to research assistant roles, preference will be given to students closer to graduation and fit within each project’s substantive area will be considered.  Unfortunately, the number of applications for research assistant roles will far exceed the number of available positions.  It is possible that matches will not work out in the initial stage and we’ll revisit the applicant pool to fill all available positions.  All students will be notified of their application’s status at the end of the add/drop/swap period.\n\nIf you have any questions, please reach out to QTM's Director of Undergraduate Research - Dr. Kevin McAlister (kevin.mcalister@emory.edu). \n \nBest, \n \nSadie Hannans\nUndergraduate Program Coordinator\nDepartment of Quantitative Theory & Methods\nEmory University\nEmail: shanna9@emory.edu | 470-620-7981\n(she/her/hers)"

Panelists will highlight cutting-edge research in statistics as well as the importance of statistical research and training for other disciplines.  The panel discussion will explore developments in machine learning and the statistical questions that motivate its growth, ways to foster interactions with domains that are enriched by the statistical sciences, and future areas of exploration for statistical research.\nRegister to attend online at: events.nationalacademies.org/...\n \n \nSubmitted by Sandra Ruhlman Smith\n \n \n \n \n \nAnnouncement\n \nMessage from Michael Garcia, Program Director at AI Innovators \n \nAI Innovators an educational program committed to empowering the next generation of social science researchers to learn and apply artificial intelligence to push the frontiers of their fields. As generative AI technologies make an impact across disciplines, the possibilities for students to apply AI to projects such as identifying pockets of unregistered voters and scanning millions of legal documents for relevant information are endless.\nPhil Bell, a Harvard Education School alum and previous classroom instructor who teaches AI and Social Sciences at Inspirit, has developed novel approaches to linguistic analysis to mitigate bias in news reporting! We’d love to make the 2023 AI Innovation Fellowship in Interdisciplinary Data Science available to students.\n \nWe believe strong data analysis and AI skills improve the quality of research and job preparation for social sciences students. Developed and taught by MIT and Stanford graduates, the AI and Political Science/Law Innovation Fellowship in summer 2023 offers students the opportunity to gain an endorsed technical skillset and complete a shareable AI project to advance their research and career ambitions.\n \nArtificial Intelligence and Political Science/Law Summer Program by Stanford GraduatesThe AI Innovators program offers a 25-hour education experience in Interdisciplinary Data Science which equips students in the arts with in-demand skills like data analysis in Python, statistics in R, and machine learning. Leveraging these new tools, students build out a professional portfolio with capstone projects such as news bias detection and algorithmic justice that draw on their unique interests. Please find more information about relevant projects here and apply here.
