        "content": "SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT\n Emory's Center for AI Learning is now accepting applications to participate in the Spring 2025 AI. Data Lab program!\n AI.DataLab is a 10 week, data micro-consulting project hosted by the Center for AI Learning where students will work in teams to solve real-world problems with data. Each team will gain exposure to the world of professional data analytics by tackling issues presented by companies in the Atlanta area and developing data-driven solutions for them. For this iteration, students will have the opportunity to work with the following organizations:\n\t\u2022\tTechBridge (TB): TB is a non-profit whose mission is to alleviate generational poverty by equipping other non-profits with enterprise-grade software and technology. Students will investigate and leverage over 18+ years of transactional national data to improve the foundational algorithm for TB's flagship software addressing hunger relief.\n\t\u2022\tSustainability Office (SO): The Emory Sustainability Office is interested in invoking sustainability into AI practices. This project will task students to creatively brainstorm how to approach either better understanding energy usage of AI, how to inform users of their individual AI tool behaviors' impact on energy, and/or how Emory could measure and report on sustainable AI practices.\n\t\u2022\tEmory Department of Chemistry (C): Over the last 10 years, the Department of Chemistry has revamped its curriculum to improve the experience of Chemistry majors. After collecting a large amount of evaluation and survey data, this AI.DataLab project will analyze the success of the curriculum overhaul and pitch how the department can continue to improve. \t\u2022\tInvestAtlanta (IA): IA is a local government authority for Atlanta focused on the economic and equitable improvement of the city. Students will conduct a sentiment analysis of governmental-adjacent agencies, like InvestAtlanta, to understand public perception of agencies that work in this industry.\nStudents with all kinds of experience levels are encouraged to apply. However, selected students will be expected to be able to work with Python in order to perform analysis. Teams will be created in such a way to induce the greatest experiential diversity within each team as to allow those with less experience to learn from students with more background in programming. Undergraduate students are eligible to receive 1 credit hour in INTERN496R to achieve their Experience & Application (XA) credit for their participation.\nAll participants in the AI.DataLab program will be expected to attend weekly meetings on Thursdays from 6:00 - 7:30 in White Hall. These meetings are meant to provide students with a common time and location to work with their teams. Topics can range from soft skills, such as data storytelling, to hard skills like string processing. Therefore, students applying must have this block of time free in their weekly schedule --at least two-thirds of these weekly meetings must be attended to earn a Pass/Satisfactory grade, and/or to be credited in final deliverables. If this time does not work for you, AI.DataLab will be offered in subsequent semesters and you are encouraged to apply for later iterations.\n Applications are due by 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday, January 21.The first weekly meeting will take place at 6:00PM on January 30th. If you have any questions, please reach out to tottoli@emory.edu.\n The application can be found here: https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=nPsE4KSwT0K80DImBtXfONoMV0zVh_FDuG1Bf6CV029UNzhRNFUwMUM2SUxOSzhYSDBBVDYxSk9OUC4u.\n  Sadie Hannans\nUndergraduate Program Coordinator\nDepartment of Quantitative Theory & Methods\nEmory University\nEmail: shanna9@emory.edu | 470-620-7981\n(she/her/hers)",

How do I get from chatting with ChatGPT to talking about larger AI products? How do I answer these nonstop questions from colleagues, customers, leadership and more in this new landscape? Do you find yourself needing expertise on AI that, quite frankly, you didn\u2019t sign up for? This course is designed to meet the needs of people who are not necessarily well-versed in math and science but who know that they need to know the basics about AI in this changing landscape. You\u2019ll learn about what AI can accomplish, the intuitions behind how it works (no math or coding necessary!), and opportunities and risks.

We support interdisciplinary research that explores the impact of Black thought on social justice movements and contemporary debates, ensuring that cultural expressions are accessible for future scholarship and public engagement.\n We offer training programs for Black students from the Atlanta metro area and HBCUs, equipping them with skills in coding, digital humanities, AI, and LLMs, preparing them for leadership in academia, technology, and public history.\n A key focus of our work is extracting \"thick data\" from archival research and ethnographic studies to inform the design of AI systems and the development of Black-centered datasets and ethical AI frameworks.\n Our Risk-Informed Design Pipeline identifies and addresses potential harms in AI development, ensuring that AI models are accurate and socially responsible. We also develop and curate datasets that reflect Black experiences, contributing to the creation of fair and robust AI models.\n Signature projects include the Atlanta Black Philosophy, Theology, and Art Archive, the Thick Data Collection Initiative, Black-Centered Algorithmic Fairness, and Mapping Black Atlanta, an interactive digital map of significant sites in the city\u2019s Black history.\n Please share this with any interested students. They can learn more about the Lab and opportunities by visiting our website. https://sites.google.com/view/alextolbertlab/about\u201d\n  Sadie Hannans\nUndergraduate Program Coordinator\nDepartment of Quantitative Theory & Methods\nEmory University\nEmail: shanna9@emory.edu | 470-620-7981\n(she/her/hers)",

        "content": "Hello QTM Majors and Minors,\n I hope you are enjoying your semester thus far. As add/drop/swap is still in full swing, I want to mention to you a course that you may be interested in. It is QTM 185 Applied Topics in QTM: Ethical Emerging Technologies Section 3, Class Nbr 6198 that meets Thursdays at 5pm-7pminNew Psyc Bldg 220 (36 Eagle Row). This course is for 2 credit hours and is a great course to add to your schedule if you have schedule space for it. Many times, as you will discover in order to complete a major or minor you may need a credit or two to meet the total credit hour requirements for that major/minor. Even though this course is not a QTM required 300+ level elective, it is a great elective course to fulfil the total 50- 54 credit hour requirement if you are lacking a credit or two. So, take a look on atlas for the course description and if you can, consider taking this course. \n Best, \n Sadie neHannans\nUndergraduate Program Coordinator\nDepartment of Quantitative Theory & Methods\nEmory University\nEmail: shanna9@emory.edu | 470-620-7981\n(she/her/hers)",
