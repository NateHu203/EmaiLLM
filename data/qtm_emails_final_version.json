        "content": "SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT\n Emory's Center for AI Learning is now accepting applications to participate in the Spring 2025 AI. Data Lab program!\n AI.DataLab is a 10 week, data micro-consulting project hosted by the Center for AI Learning where students will work in teams to solve real-world problems with data. Each team will gain exposure to the world of professional data analytics by tackling issues presented by companies in the Atlanta area and developing data-driven solutions for them. For this iteration, students will have the opportunity to work with the following organizations:\n\t\u2022\tTechBridge (TB): TB is a non-profit whose mission is to alleviate generational poverty by equipping other non-profits with enterprise-grade software and technology. Students will investigate and leverage over 18+ years of transactional national data to improve the foundational algorithm for TB's flagship software addressing hunger relief.\n\t\u2022\tSustainability Office (SO): The Emory Sustainability Office is interested in invoking sustainability into AI practices. This project will task students to creatively brainstorm how to approach either better understanding energy usage of AI, how to inform users of their individual AI tool behaviors' impact on energy, and/or how Emory could measure and report on sustainable AI practices.\n\t\u2022\tEmory Department of Chemistry (C): Over the last 10 years, the Department of Chemistry has revamped its curriculum to improve the experience of Chemistry majors. After collecting a large amount of evaluation and survey data, this AI.DataLab project will analyze the success of the curriculum overhaul and pitch how the department can continue to improve. \t\u2022\tInvestAtlanta (IA): IA is a local government authority for Atlanta focused on the economic and equitable improvement of the city. Students will conduct a sentiment analysis of governmental-adjacent agencies, like InvestAtlanta, to understand public perception of agencies that work in this industry.\nStudents with all kinds of experience levels are encouraged to apply. However, selected students will be expected to be able to work with Python in order to perform analysis. Teams will be created in such a way to induce the greatest experiential diversity within each team as to allow those with less experience to learn from students with more background in programming. Undergraduate students are eligible to receive 1 credit hour in INTERN496R to achieve their Experience & Application (XA) credit for their participation.\nAll participants in the AI.DataLab program will be expected to attend weekly meetings on Thursdays from 6:00 - 7:30 in White Hall. These meetings are meant to provide students with a common time and location to work with their teams. Topics can range from soft skills, such as data storytelling, to hard skills like string processing. Therefore, students applying must have this block of time free in their weekly schedule --at least two-thirds of these weekly meetings must be attended to earn a Pass/Satisfactory grade, and/or to be credited in final deliverables. If this time does not work for you, AI.DataLab will be offered in subsequent semesters and you are encouraged to apply for later iterations.\n Applications are due by 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday, January 21.The first weekly meeting will take place at 6:00PM on January 30th. If you have any questions, please reach out to tottoli@emory.edu.\n The application can be found here: https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=nPsE4KSwT0K80DImBtXfONoMV0zVh_FDuG1Bf6CV029UNzhRNFUwMUM2SUxOSzhYSDBBVDYxSk9OUC4u.\n  Sadie Hannans\nUndergraduate Program Coordinator\nDepartment of Quantitative Theory & Methods\nEmory University\nEmail: shanna9@emory.edu | 470-620-7981\n(she/her/hers)",

How do I get from chatting with ChatGPT to talking about larger AI products? How do I answer these nonstop questions from colleagues, customers, leadership and more in this new landscape? Do you find yourself needing expertise on AI that, quite frankly, you didn\u2019t sign up for?

We support interdisciplinary research that explores the impact of Black thought on social justice movements and contemporary debates, ensuring that cultural expressions are accessible for future scholarship and public engagement.\n We offer training programs for Black students from the Atlanta metro area and HBCUs, equipping them with skills in coding, digital humanities, AI, and LLMs, preparing them for leadership in academia, technology, and public history.\n A key focus of our work is extracting \"thick data\" from archival research and ethnographic studies to inform the design of AI systems and the development of Black-centered datasets and ethical AI frameworks.\n Our Risk-Informed Design Pipeline identifies and addresses potential harms in AI development, ensuring that AI models are accurate and socially responsible. We also develop and curate datasets that reflect Black experiences, contributing to the creation of fair and robust AI models.\n Signature projects include the Atlanta Black Philosophy, Theology, and Art Archive, the Thick Data Collection Initiative, Black-Centered Algorithmic Fairness, and Mapping Black Atlanta, an interactive digital map of significant sites in the city\u2019s Black history.\n Please share this with any interested students. They can learn more about the Lab and opportunities by visiting our website. https://sites.google.com/view/alextolbertlab/about\u201d\n  Sadie Hannans\nUndergraduate Program Coordinator\nDepartment of Quantitative Theory & Methods\nEmory University\nEmail: shanna9@emory.edu | 470-620-7981\n(she/her/hers)",

As add/drop/swap is still in full swing, I want to mention to you a course that you may be interested in. It is QTM 185 Applied Topics in QTM: Ethical Emerging Technologies Section 3, Class Nbr 6198 that meets Thursdays at 5pm-7pminNew Psyc Bldg 220 (36 Eagle Row). This course is for 2 credit hours and is a great course to add to your schedule if you have schedule space for it. Many times, as you will discover in order to complete a major or minor you may need a credit or two to meet the total credit hour requirements for that major/minor. Even though this course is not a QTM required 300+ level elective, it is a great elective course to fulfil the total 50- 54 credit hour requirement if you are lacking a credit or two. So, take a look on atlas for the course description and if you can, consider taking this course. \n Best, \n Sadie neHannans\nUndergraduate Program Coordinator\nDepartment of Quantitative Theory & Methods\nEmory University\nEmail: shanna9@emory.edu | 470-620-7981\n(she/her/hers)",

Data visualization, including sketching by hand and plotting in R, will be emphasized as a tool for making this connection.\n\u00a0\nA modern, mathematically rigorous introduction to statistical modeling and data-driven decision-making that provides a foundation for upper-level classes in the department. We will focus on prediction---using data we have to tell us something about data we don't, statistical inference---characterizing the uncertainty we have about the accuracy of these predictions, and causal inference---understanding what the relationships we see in the data tell us about the impact of actions we might take. While the class will emphasize the intuitive and mathematical foundations of these concepts, we will also cover the implementation of these techniques in applications using the statistical programming language R.\n\u00a0\nTo succeed in this course, students should have the same prerequisites as for QTM 220: (QTM 110 or QTM_OX 110) & (QTM 150 or QTM_OX 150) & (QTM 120 or MATH 210 or MATH_OX 210 or MATH_211 or MATH_OX 211) & [QTM 210 or QTM_OX 210 or ECON 220 or ECON_OX 220 or (MATH 361 and MATH 362)] & (MATH 221 or MATH_OX 221) or equivalent.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSadie Hannans\nUndergraduate Program Coordinator\nDepartment of Quantitative Theory & Methods\nEmory University\nEmail: shanna9@emory.edu | 470-620-7981\n(she/her/hers)",

For example, QTM majors and minors who participate may choose to count this experience as 3 credit hours of\u00a0QTM 498R. QTM 498R may\u00a0count as a 300+ level elective towards your QTM degree (or as an experiential elective for those on the Data Science track).\u00a0 Note that most QTM majors/minors may only count one semester of QTM 498R or QTM 495A/495BW towards their degree. We will work with your department's leadership to confirm what course codes are applicable for your experience.\n\u00a0\nStudents who choose to take advantage of any of these options will be required to pay the associated tuition. You can notate if you would like to enroll in 3 or 6 credit hours, which would impact whether financial aid could be applied.

The tuition cost and information about need-based financial aid can be found at https://oue.college.emory.edu/advising/summer-school/tuition-financial-aid.html.\n\u00a0\nStudents will be asked in this survey whether they are interested in counting this program towards an elective course requirement, as opposed to treating this experience as an internship without credit.

Our yearlong program has prepared recent college graduates for 30 years to launch a career in environmental \u00a0organizing and advocacy by providing hands-on experience running campaigns with groups like the Wilderness Society, Endangered Species Coalition, Mighty Earth and more. We then connect our graduates to jobs in the environmental and social change movement.\n\u00a0\nGreen Corps Organizer Program - The Field School for Environmental Organizing\nGreen Corps is looking for college graduates who are ready to take on the biggest environmental challenges of our day.\nLearn more and apply on our website!\n\u00a0\nThe planet needs all the help it can get. To win now and build a strong foundation for lasting progress, we need people who know how to organize: to run organizations and campaigns that will inspire the support and action we need to save our environment. Our program starts with intensive classroom training. You learn about issues and campaigns, organizing theory and principles, and skills from recruiting volunteers to staging a media event. Then, you move to a more hands-on experience. You make a difference on important campaigns to transition our country to clean energy, protect wildlife, and more. For example, Lauren Karpinski, an organizer from the Green Corps Class of 2019, brought together a coalition of 40 groups that helped win a landmark solar energy bill in Arkansas.\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019re accepting the top 20 candidates for our 2024-2025 program. Graduates will join our more than 400 alumni who are leading environmental campaigns and organizations across the country. If you\u2019re passionate about the environment and ready to learn and practice the craft of organizing after graduation, apply today!\n\u00a0\nNot a graduating senior? Add your name to our list to receive updates about Green Corps including summer internships and jobs in the environmental and broader social change field!\n\u00a0\nGreen Corps\u2019 year-long program begins in August 2024 with introductory classroom training, and continues with field placements in multiple locations across the U.S. Candidates must be willing to relocate. Please contact Margaret Corcoran at margaret@greencorps.org with additional questions.\n\u00a0\nGreen Corps is part of The Public Interest Network, which operates and supports organizations committed to a shared vision of a better world and a\u00a0 strategic approach to social change. Visit publicinterestnetwork.org to learn more. Green Corps is an equal opportunity employer. The target annual compensation for this position is $32,500 (but compensation may range between $32,500 and $39,000 depending on location). Green Corps' benefits package includes medical insurance for employees and dependents, needs-based student loan assistance, commuter benefit program, sick pay (60-72 hours/year depending on location), and 80 hours (2 weeks) of accrued vacation. We also offer short-term positions, an excellent training program, and opportunities for advancement.\n\u00a0\nNeed more information contact her at (617) 901-6114.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLUNCH & LEARN\n\u00a0\nThe Emory Center for Digital Scholarship (ECDS) and the Envisioning Baroque Rome digital humanities project invite you for a one-hour round-table Lunch & Learn at noon\u00a0on Thursday, March 21st in Woodruff Library.\nEnjoy a provided lunch while the project team discusses the process of building a 3D model of the city of Rome. Envisioning Baroque Rome began in 2013 with the goal of rebuilding Rome in 1676 according to the map of that year, Nuova piante et alzata della citt\u00e0 di Roma, and other prints by artist Giovanni Battista Falda. Led by Sarah McPhee, Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Art History, the round-table will include ECDS staff Joanna Mundy, Ian Burr, and John Halbert, and artist Nicole Costello Matthews. The team will discuss the research, modeling, texturing, and animation of Baroque Rome, and you will have an opportunity to explore the newest version of the 3D city yourself!\n\u00a0\nLearn about the recent research in the project and stroll the streets of Rome with Giovanni Battista Falda.\n\u00a0\nWe hope that you are able to attend.

KEVIN MCALISTER, QTM DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH\n\u00a0\nDataThink is a 10-week data micro-consulting project hosted by the QTM Department and Center for Artificial Intelligence Learning where students will work in teams to solve real problems with real data. Each team will learn the context of the problem and develop a data-driven solution. Participants will gain exposure to the world of professional data analytics, working on projects very similar to those that analysts would in their day-to-day work.\nEach team of 5 will be working with data from the Better Business Bureau (BBB) to develop insights to understand how to better communicate with businesses (particularly women and black-owned businesses) that do not currently take advantage of the BBB's local business credibility services. Teams will work together to develop an analysis given the research question to be presented as a poster at the DataThink end of year showcase with the best projects (as judged by a panel of data scientists from around the Atlanta community) receiving a best-in-show award and having the teams' names placed on a plaque.\u00a0 Students will also prepare a 3-minute lightning talk to describe their work and conclusions that will be presented to the BBB.\u00a0 The end-of-semester showcase and presentations will be an excellent opportunity to meet with data scientists from around Emory's campus and in the Atlanta community at large.Beginning this semester, all participants in the DataThink program will be expected to attend weekly meetings on\u00a0Tuesdays from 5:30 - 6:45 in PAIS 290.\u00a0\u00a0The goal of these meetings is to provide students with a common time and place to meet with their teams and discuss how their analysis can progress.\u00a0 Additionally, each weekly meeting will begin with a 20-minute lecture on an important topic in data science that you may or may not have covered in any of your previous classes.\u00a0 Topics will include developing meaningful summary tables, string processing, joining multiple data sources using SQL syntax, effectively designing a project poster, etc.To be allowed at the end of semester event, students must attend at least two-thirds of these weekly meetings.\u00a0 Attendance will be checked via QR code.\u00a0 As such, it is expected that students applying to participate in this program will have this block of time free in their weekly schedule.\u00a0 If this time does not work for you, know that the DataThink program will be offered each semester and you are more than welcome to apply in later semesters.\u00a0\u00a0Students with all kinds of experience levels are encouraged to apply. However, selected students will be expected to be able to work with Python in order to perform analysis.\u00a0 Teams will be created in such a way to induce the greatest experiential diversity within each team as to allow those with less experience to learn from students with more background in programming.\u00a0 \u00a0Selected students will gain experience in the following areas:\n\t\u2022\tData Storytelling\n\t\u2022\tInsight development for a real client\n\t\u2022\tProfessional experience to build one\u2019s resume\n\t\u2022\tIn-demand data technical skills such as Python, SQL, and data visualization tools\n\t\u2022\tCollaboration and teamwork in the data space\nTo be considered, please have your application in by\u00a05:00 PM on Wednesday, January 31st.\u00a0 The application can be found at https://forms.office.com/r/NaVXn8Q0T8.\u00a0 If the embedded hyperlink does not work, please copy and paste this address into your browser:\u00a0https://forms.office.com/r/NaVXn8Q0T8\n\u00a0\nThe first weekly meeting will take place at\u00a05:30 on February 6th.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to Kevin McAlister at kevin.mcalister@emory.edu.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSadie Hannans\nUndergraduate Program Coordinator\nDepartment of Quantitative Theory & Methods\nEmory University\nEmail: shanna9@emory.edu | 470-620-7981\n(she/her/hers)",

The program culminates in a four-day intensive session in Atlanta (March 16 - March 19), where students apply their learning in a high-stakes negotiation scenario in drafting, debating, and adopting a text as if they were members of the Global Partnership on AI.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDesigned to bridge the gap between academic study and real-world policy challenges, Simuvaction is an opportunity for students to not only understand the intricacies of AI ethics but also to raise their voice on a topic which will shape their future.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe deadline for enrollment is December 15, 2023. Scheduled class dates are January 15 - March 20, 2024.

Survival data from clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of therapies in a cancer subtype may be limited. You will explore use of other sources of data; based on alternative outcomes, study types or other cancers, which may need to be synthesised efficiently for reliable policy decisions. \nYou will apply a range of modern tools from biostatistics (including Bayesian statistics, meta-analysis and survival analysis), epidemiology and data science and develop novel approaches for evaluation of cancer therapies.\nThis project is part of an exciting collaboration with University of Birmingham and AstraZeneca. You will benefit from an experienced supervisory team with expertise in statistics and oncology and an industry partner. This PhD in Biostatistics will provide you with an opportunity to develop advanced analytical skills, gain insight into drug development and decision-making processes and influence important decisions in healthcare. A suitable candidate will have MSc in Statistics, Medical Statistics or a related discipline.\n\u00a0\nSee https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmore.bham.ac.uk%2Fmrc-aim%2Fphd-opportunities%2F&data=05%7C01%7Csylwia.bujkiewicz%40leicester.ac.uk%7C3dc05dbfa44849db697908dbf0bc24b9%7Caebecd6a31d44b0195ce8274afe853d9%7C0%7C0%7C638368463077853590%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=gS7m1yB5qg35tR4HV3muMdfYCe1JhBNjFTy9IPL%2FGSs%3D&reserved=0\u00a0for more details.\n\u00a0\nApplication deadline Friday 12 January 2024.\u00a0Open to UK and international students.\n\u00a0\nWebinars for prospective applicants:\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monday 11 December at 18:30 GMT\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wednesday 13 December 2023 at 11:00 GMT.\n\u00a0\nhttps://le.ac.uk/study/research-degrees/funded-opportunities/mrc-aim-dtp\n\u00a0\nQuestions?

JO GULDI\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nQTM 490R: Research Lab\n\u201cUsing AI to Assess the Documentary History of Climate Change: A Multidisciplinary Approach\u201d\n\u00a0\nAs carbon and methane emissions shape our shared future, one essential question is how organizations, institutions, and markets are adopting or failing to adopt new regulations and practices for carbon mitigation and adaptation. An enormous number of published texts document the regulatory life of organizations involved with climate change, including the publications the United Nations, the quarterly reports of U.S Corporations, the World Bank Reports, the Building Codes that govern city, county, and state sustainability plans, and the bills passed by nations. \n\u00a0\nTo date, few scholars have attempted to deploy AI to inspect this documentary record.\u00a0 As a result, we have little insight into the successes, failures, and promise of initiatives represented by this documentary base. Research in Computer Science by specialists in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the Digital Humanities (DH), however, hold promising keys for moving from large language models to accurate depictions of historical change in the recent past.\n\u00a0\nOur research will apply these new methods to understanding contemporary institutions. We will connect modern white-box methods from Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Digital Humanities (DH) to the data of climate change governance, illuminating the history of official promises and regulation attempts, and allowing researchers to assemble a timeline and critical account of how climate governance has been changing over the past five, ten, and twenty years.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nWhat will the course be like? In a research lab, we don\u2019t have a set syllabus as in a seminar or lecture series. In lab meetings, student teams plan ambitious projects of understanding, hear from invited experts, plan to seek out specialty knowledge around campus, and present their results for group review.\u00a0 Readings are assigned as students require input to direct their work on a series of interrelated research problems that they work on in teams. The result is that every student participates actively in shaping their own research agenda, with guidance from the professor and other students.\n\u00a0\nWhat will I study? Current research projects include these topics:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The historical analysis of text over time, showing the evolution of political promises, regulation, commodities trends, and technological adaptation across different nations and markets \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal issues about corporate and state responsibility\u00a0 \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sociological and historical questions about the evolution of institutions and promises in Brazil, Tanzania and Ethiopia and other developing nations, as well as issues about the inclusion of indigenous property rights and political participation \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Statistical inference about relationships between text-based promises and quantitative data on climate change, for instance, electricity bills, satellite data showing rainforest cover,\u00a0 georeferenced carbon emissions, and data about human displacement and conflict, so as to determine where political and corporate promises have been realized \n\u00a0\nWhat data will I be working with? Databases we are being assembled by students involved with Guldi Lab include these:\n\t\u2022\tThe documentary publications of the UN regarding REDD, the governance framework for assessing rainforest governance\n\t\u2022\tEDGAR, quarterly reports of U.S. publicly-listed corporations discussing their investments in climate mitigation technologies as well as their interest in a shifting profile of agricultural products\n\t\u2022\tThe MEDIACLOUD database of news stories from major cities as well as the developing world\n\t\u2022\tThe reports of the WORLD BANK that govern major investments in the developing world\n\t\u2022\tMUNICODE, a database of building codes from American cities, counties, and states which govern the standard of sustainability to which new buildings must be built\n\t\u2022\tThe CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, the annals of debate in the U.S. Congress \n\u00a0\nWhat does it mean to take a multidisciplinary approach to climate governance?

Research in Computer Science by specialists in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the Digital Humanities (DH), however, hold promising keys for moving from large language models to accurate depictions of historical change in the recent past.\n\u00a0\nOur research will apply these new methods to understanding contemporary institutions. We will connect modern white-box methods from Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Digital Humanities (DH) to the data of climate change governance, illuminating the history of official promises and regulation attempts, and allowing researchers to assemble a timeline and critical account of how climate governance has been changing over the past five, ten, and twenty years.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nWhat will the course be like? In a research lab, we don\u2019t have a set syllabus as in a seminar or lecture series. In lab meetings, student teams plan ambitious projects of understanding, hear from invited experts, plan to seek out specialty knowledge around campus, and present their results for group review.\u00a0 Readings are assigned as students require input to direct their work on a series of interrelated research problems that they work on in teams. The result is that every student participates actively in shaping their own research agenda, with guidance from the professor and other students.\n\u00a0\nWhat will I study? Current research projects include these topics:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The historical analysis of text over time, showing the evolution of political promises, regulation, commodities trends, and technological adaptation across different nations and markets \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal issues about corporate and state responsibility\u00a0 \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sociological and historical questions about the evolution of institutions and promises in Brazil, Tanzania and Ethiopia and other developing nations, as well as issues about the inclusion of indigenous property rights and political participation \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Statistical inference about relationships between text-based promises and quantitative data on climate change, for instance, electricity bills, satellite data showing rainforest cover,\u00a0 georeferenced carbon emissions, and data about human displacement and conflict, so as to determine where political and corporate promises have been realized \n\u00a0\nWhat data will I be working with? Databases we are being assembled by students involved with Guldi Lab include these:\n\t\u2022\tThe documentary publications of the UN regarding REDD, the governance framework for assessing rainforest governance\n\t\u2022\tEDGAR, quarterly reports of U.S. publicly-listed corporations discussing their investments in climate mitigation technologies as well as their interest in a shifting profile of agricultural products\n\t\u2022\tThe MEDIACLOUD database of news stories from major cities as well as the developing world\n\t\u2022\tThe reports of the WORLD BANK that govern major investments in the developing world\n\t\u2022\tMUNICODE, a database of building codes from American cities, counties, and states which govern the standard of sustainability to which new buildings must be built\n\t\u2022\tThe CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, the annals of debate in the U.S. Congress \n\u00a0\nWhat does it mean to take a multidisciplinary approach to climate governance?
