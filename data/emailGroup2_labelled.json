In this program, students will work in teams of 5 to complete one of many different data science consulting projects. Each of these projects will contain a mixture of programming and data analysis tasks that will require developing a strong substantive knowledge surrounding the problem.\n\u00a0\nTo be selected, students need to:\n\t\u2022\tHave been enrolled in classes at Emory in the Spring 2024 semester and be enrolled at Emory in the Fall 2024 semester.\n\t\u2022\tBe in residence in Atlanta, GA between July 1 and August 15.\n\t\u2022\tAttend 3 or 4 in-person team meetings per week.\n\t\u2022\tBe able to commit roughly 20 hours per week to the project over the 6 week period.\n\t\u2022\tHave knowledge of common statistical analysis and machine learning methods\n\t\u2022\tHave experience programming in R and/or Python:\n\t\u25e6\tAbility to load in and manipulate large data sets\n\t\u25e6\tAbility to clean potentially messy data into workable formats\n\t\u25e6\tKnowledge of common programming control structures\u00a0\n\t\u25e6\tAbility to write and debug original functions\n\t\u25e6\tAbility to implement common statistical analysis and machine learning methods\n\t\u25e6\tAbility to read documentation about new methods and implement them\n\u00a0\nReview of applications will begin on March 7, 2024.\u00a0 However, all applications will be considered if submitted prior to 5:00 PM on March 19, 2024.\u00a0 Prior to final selection, some students may be asked to do a short in-person interview.\u00a0 All students will be informed of the status of their application no later than March 21, 2024.\n\u00a0\nStudents who are admitted to this program will have the option to participate in exchange for credit. For example, QTM majors and minors who participate may choose to count this experience as 3 credit hours of\u00a0QTM 498R. QTM 498R may\u00a0count as a 300+ level elective towards your QTM degree (or as an experiential elective for those on the Data Science track).\u00a0 Note that most QTM majors/minors may only count one semester of QTM 498R or QTM 495A/495BW towards their degree. We will work with your department's leadership to confirm what course codes are applicable for your experience.\n\u00a0\nStudents who choose to take advantage of any of these options will be required to pay the associated tuition. You can notate if you would like to enroll in 3 or 6 credit hours, which would impact whether financial aid could be applied. Unfortunately, our funding model does not allow us to cover this tuition, so paying this will be your responsibility. The tuition cost and information about need-based financial aid can be found at https://oue.college.emory.edu/advising/summer-school/tuition-financial-aid.html.\n\u00a0\nStudents will be asked in this survey whether they are interested in counting this program towards an elective course requirement, as opposed to treating this experience as an internship without credit. Students will also be asked about their potential financial plan in order to enroll in the program in this survey.\n\u00a0\nThe application for this program can be found here.\u00a0 If the hyperlink is not working, copy and paste the following link in your browser: https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=nPsE4KSwT0K80DImBtXfOK9f-T_naQBMvN-s-998aalUN0NIR0Q4NzJYNVNXUVlHSUZTUUhaSEI0Wi4u\n\u00a0\nIf there are any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to Dr. Kevin McAlister (kevin.mcalister@emory.edu). \u00a0To schedule office hours or advising appointments with Dr. McAlister, please use this booking page.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSadie Hannans\nUndergraduate Program Coordinator\nDepartment of Quantitative Theory & Methods\nEmory University\nEmail: shanna9@emory.edu | 470-620-7981\n(she/her/hers)"

In this program, students will work in teams of 5 to complete one of many different data science consulting projects. Each of these projects will contain a mixture of programming and data analysis tasks that will require developing a strong substantive knowledge surrounding the problem.\n\u00a0\nTo be selected, students need to:\n\t\u2022\tHave been enrolled in classes at Emory in the Spring 2024 semester and be enrolled at Emory in the Fall 2024 semester.\n\t\u2022\tBe in residence in Atlanta, GA between July 1 and August 15.\n\t\u2022\tAttend 3 or 4 in-person team meetings per week.\n\t\u2022\tBe able to commit roughly 20 hours per week to the project over the 6 week period.\n\t\u2022\tHave knowledge of common statistical analysis and machine learning methods\n\t\u2022\tHave experience programming in R and/or Python:\n\t\u25e6\tAbility to load in and manipulate large data sets\n\t\u25e6\tAbility to clean potentially messy data into workable formats\n\t\u25e6\tKnowledge of common programming control structures\u00a0\n\t\u25e6\tAbility to write and debug original functions\n\t\u25e6\tAbility to implement common statistical analysis and machine learning methods\n\t\u25e6\tAbility to read documentation about new methods and implement them\n\u00a0\nReview of applications will begin on March 7, 2024.\u00a0 However, all applications will be considered if submitted prior to 5:00 PM on March 19, 2024.\u00a0 Prior to final selection, some students may be asked to do a short in-person interview.\u00a0 All students will be informed of the status of their application no later than March 21, 2024.\n\u00a0\nStudents who are admitted to this program will have the option to participate in exchange for credit. For example, QTM majors and minors who participate may choose to count this experience as 3 credit hours of\u00a0QTM 498R. QTM 498R may\u00a0count as a 300+ level elective towards your QTM degree (or as an experiential elective for those on the Data Science track).\u00a0 Note that most QTM majors/minors may only count one semester of QTM 498R or QTM 495A/495BW towards their degree. We will work with your department's leadership to confirm what course codes are applicable for your experience.\n\u00a0\nStudents who choose to take advantage of any of these options will be required to pay the associated tuition. You can notate if you would like to enroll in 3 or 6 credit hours, which would impact whether financial aid could be applied. Unfortunately, our funding model does not allow us to cover this tuition, so paying this will be your responsibility. The tuition cost and information about need-based financial aid can be found at https://oue.college.emory.edu/advising/summer-school/tuition-financial-aid.html.\n\u00a0\nStudents will be asked in this survey whether they are interested in counting this program towards an elective course requirement, as opposed to treating this experience as an internship without credit. Students will also be asked about their potential financial plan in order to enroll in the program in this survey.\n\u00a0\nThe application for this program can be found here.\u00a0 If the hyperlink is not working, copy and paste the following link in your browser: https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=nPsE4KSwT0K80DImBtXfOK9f-T_naQBMvN-s-998aalUN0NIR0Q4NzJYNVNXUVlHSUZTUUhaSEI0Wi4u\n\u00a0\nIf there are any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to Dr. Kevin McAlister (kevin.mcalister@emory.edu). \u00a0To schedule office hours or advising appointments with Dr. McAlister, please use this booking page.\n\nBest, \n\u00a0\nSadie Hannans\nUndergraduate Program Coordinator\nDepartment of Quantitative Theory & Methods\nEmory University\nEmail: shanna9@emory.edu | 470-620-7981\n(she/her/hers)"

Our yearlong program has prepared recent college graduates for 30 years to launch a career in environmental \u00a0organizing and advocacy by providing hands-on experience running campaigns with groups like the Wilderness Society, Endangered Species Coalition, Mighty Earth and more. We then connect our graduates to jobs in the environmental and social change movement.\n\u00a0\nGreen Corps Organizer Program - The Field School for Environmental Organizing\nGreen Corps is looking for college graduates who are ready to take on the biggest environmental challenges of our day.\nLearn more and apply on our website!\n\u00a0\nThe planet needs all the help it can get. To win now and build a strong foundation for lasting progress, we need people who know how to organize: to run organizations and campaigns that will inspire the support and action we need to save our environment. Our program starts with intensive classroom training. You learn about issues and campaigns, organizing theory and principles, and skills from recruiting volunteers to staging a media event. Then, you move to a more hands-on experience. You make a difference on important campaigns to transition our country to clean energy, protect wildlife, and more. For example, Lauren Karpinski, an organizer from the Green Corps Class of 2019, brought together a coalition of 40 groups that helped win a landmark solar energy bill in Arkansas.\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019re accepting the top 20 candidates for our 2024-2025 program. Graduates will join our more than 400 alumni who are leading environmental campaigns and organizations across the country. If you\u2019re passionate about the environment and ready to learn and practice the craft of organizing after graduation, apply today!\n\u00a0\nNot a graduating senior? Add your name to our list to receive updates about Green Corps including summer internships and jobs in the environmental and broader social change field!\n\u00a0\nGreen Corps\u2019 year-long program begins in August 2024 with introductory classroom training, and continues with field placements in multiple locations across the U.S. Candidates must be willing to relocate. Please contact Margaret Corcoran at margaret@greencorps.org with additional questions.\n\u00a0\nGreen Corps is part of The Public Interest Network, which operates and supports organizations committed to a shared vision of a better world and a\u00a0 strategic approach to social change. Visit publicinterestnetwork.org to learn more. Green Corps is an equal opportunity employer. The target annual compensation for this position is $32,500 (but compensation may range between $32,500 and $39,000 depending on location). Green Corps' benefits package includes medical insurance for employees and dependents, needs-based student loan assistance, commuter benefit program, sick pay (60-72 hours/year depending on location), and 80 hours (2 weeks) of accrued vacation. We also offer short-term positions, an excellent training program, and opportunities for advancement.\n\u00a0\nNeed more information contact her at (617) 901-6114.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLUNCH & LEARN\n\u00a0\nThe Emory Center for Digital Scholarship (ECDS) and the Envisioning Baroque Rome digital humanities project invite you for a one-hour round-table Lunch & Learn at noon\u00a0on Thursday, March 21st in Woodruff Library.\nEnjoy a provided lunch while the project team discusses the process of building a 3D model of the city of Rome. Envisioning Baroque Rome began in 2013 with the goal of rebuilding Rome in 1676 according to the map of that year, Nuova piante et alzata della citt\u00e0 di Roma, and other prints by artist Giovanni Battista Falda. Led by Sarah McPhee, Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Art History, the round-table will include ECDS staff Joanna Mundy, Ian Burr, and John Halbert, and artist Nicole Costello Matthews. The team will discuss the research, modeling, texturing, and animation of Baroque Rome, and you will have an opportunity to explore the newest version of the 3D city yourself!\n\u00a0\nLearn about the recent research in the project and stroll the streets of Rome with Giovanni Battista Falda.\n\u00a0\nWe hope that you are able to attend.

        "content": "SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT FROM DR. KEVIN MCALISTER, QTM DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH\n\u00a0\nDataThink is a 10-week data micro-consulting project hosted by the QTM Department and Center for Artificial Intelligence Learning where students will work in teams to solve real problems with real data. Each team will learn the context of the problem and develop a data-driven solution. Participants will gain exposure to the world of professional data analytics, working on projects very similar to those that analysts would in their day-to-day work.\nEach team of 5 will be working with data from the Better Business Bureau (BBB) to develop insights to understand how to better communicate with businesses (particularly women and black-owned businesses) that do not currently take advantage of the BBB's local business credibility services. Teams will work together to develop an analysis given the research question to be presented as a poster at the DataThink end of year showcase with the best projects (as judged by a panel of data scientists from around the Atlanta community) receiving a best-in-show award and having the teams' names placed on a plaque.\u00a0 Students will also prepare a 3-minute lightning talk to describe their work and conclusions that will be presented to the BBB.\u00a0 The end-of-semester showcase and presentations will be an excellent opportunity to meet with data scientists from around Emory's campus and in the Atlanta community at large.Beginning this semester, all participants in the DataThink program will be expected to attend weekly meetings on\u00a0Tuesdays from 5:30 - 6:45 in PAIS 290.\u00a0\u00a0The goal of these meetings is to provide students with a common time and place to meet with their teams and discuss how their analysis can progress.\u00a0 Additionally, each weekly meeting will begin with a 20-minute lecture on an important topic in data science that you may or may not have covered in any of your previous classes.\u00a0 Topics will include developing meaningful summary tables, string processing, joining multiple data sources using SQL syntax, effectively designing a project poster, etc.To be allowed at the end of semester event, students must attend at least two-thirds of these weekly meetings.\u00a0 Attendance will be checked via QR code.\u00a0 As such, it is expected that students applying to participate in this program will have this block of time free in their weekly schedule.\u00a0 If this time does not work for you, know that the DataThink program will be offered each semester and you are more than welcome to apply in later semesters.\u00a0\u00a0Students with all kinds of experience levels are encouraged to apply. However, selected students will be expected to be able to work with Python in order to perform analysis.\u00a0 Teams will be created in such a way to induce the greatest experiential diversity within each team as to allow those with less experience to learn from students with more background in programming.\u00a0 \u00a0Selected students will gain experience in the following areas:\n\t\u2022\tData Storytelling\n\t\u2022\tInsight development for a real client\n\t\u2022\tProfessional experience to build one\u2019s resume\n\t\u2022\tIn-demand data technical skills such as Python, SQL, and data visualization tools\n\t\u2022\tCollaboration and teamwork in the data space\nTo be considered, please have your application in by\u00a05:00 PM on Wednesday, January 31st.\u00a0 The application can be found at https://forms.office.com/r/NaVXn8Q0T8.\u00a0 If the embedded hyperlink does not work, please copy and paste this address into your browser:\u00a0https://forms.office.com/r/NaVXn8Q0T8\n\u00a0\nThe first weekly meeting will take place at\u00a05:30 on February 6th.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to Kevin McAlister at kevin.mcalister@emory.edu.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSadie Hannans\nUndergraduate Program Coordinator\nDepartment of Quantitative Theory & Methods\nEmory University\nEmail: shanna9@emory.edu | 470-620-7981\n(she/her/hers)"

Survival data from clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of therapies in a cancer subtype may be limited. You will explore use of other sources of data; based on alternative outcomes, study types or other cancers, which may need to be synthesised efficiently for reliable policy decisions. \nYou will apply a range of modern tools from biostatistics (including Bayesian statistics, meta-analysis and survival analysis), epidemiology and data science and develop novel approaches for evaluation of cancer therapies.\nThis project is part of an exciting collaboration with University of Birmingham and AstraZeneca. You will benefit from an experienced supervisory team with expertise in statistics and oncology and an industry partner. This PhD in Biostatistics will provide you with an opportunity to develop advanced analytical skills, gain insight into drug development and decision-making processes and influence important decisions in healthcare. A suitable candidate will have MSc in Statistics, Medical Statistics or a related discipline.\n\u00a0\nSee https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmore.bham.ac.uk%2Fmrc-aim%2Fphd-opportunities%2F&data=05%7C01%7Csylwia.bujkiewicz%40leicester.ac.uk%7C3dc05dbfa44849db697908dbf0bc24b9%7Caebecd6a31d44b0195ce8274afe853d9%7C0%7C0%7C638368463077853590%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=gS7m1yB5qg35tR4HV3muMdfYCe1JhBNjFTy9IPL%2FGSs%3D&reserved=0\u00a0for more details.\n\u00a0\nApplication deadline Friday 12 January 2024.\u00a0Open to UK and international students.\n\u00a0\nWebinars for prospective applicants:\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monday 11 December at 18:30 GMT\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wednesday 13 December 2023 at 11:00 GMT.\n\u00a0\nhttps://le.ac.uk/study/research-degrees/funded-opportunities/mrc-aim-dtp\n\u00a0\nQuestions?

The fellowships will commence in July 2024, and they are 2 years in duration. Students can find further details here. \nAttached, please find a brochure describing the fellowships. Please feel free to print the brochure and post it in your department. I ask that you let us know that you have received this e-mail and that you forward it, along with the associated brochure, to students in the Department of Quantitative Theory and Methods. \nThe Cohen Fellowship in Developmental Social Neuroscience will involve cutting-edge social neuroscience and/or neuroimaging research in infants, toddlers and adolescents. Fellows will work to further the understanding of autism through eye-tracking research, guiding a project from the point of data collection to publication of results. \nThe Simons Fellowship in Computational Neuroscience will involve integrating computational strategies with clinical research goals. Fellows will develop methods for the analysis of visual scanning and eye-tracking data, computational models of visual salience, and data visualization techniques, all with the aim of advancing the understanding of autism and efforts at early diagnosis. \nThe Louise and Brett Samsky Fellowship in Educational Science and Practice will involve research in educational innovations in autism. Fellows will learn about classroom-based interventions to increase social emotional engagement and inclusion, gaining experiences with observational research methods, practical experience through direct classroom responsibilities, cutting edge intervention research, and implementation science approaches. \nThe Sally Provence Fellowship in Clinical Research will select fellows for a two-year training in clinical assessment measures and research methodologies to better understand ASD and related disabilities. \nThe ACCESS Fellowship in Implementation Science will select fellows for a two-year training in research focused on community engagement participatory methods, translating evidence-based treatments for autism into community settings, as well as the processes and partnerships that support these efforts. \nThank you for your help!

Every year, we host an event on Emory's campus called Haircuts for Hope, where we ask local professional hairstylists to generously donate their time to cut hair for our students so that we can donate it to Children With Hair Loss, a nonprofit organization which makes hair replacements for pediatric cancer patients. We were wondering if you could send this information and our flyer out to your department listserv.\n\u00a0\nThis year\u2019s event will be held at the Emory Student Center in N101 on November 13th from 9 am to 4 pm. The haircuts are completely free-of-charge for students, and donations must be at least 8 inches of hair. Hair can be dyed, but it must be freshly washed and healthy. The QR Code for registering for an appointment can be found on the flyer attached.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSee attached flyer\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSubmitted by Iris Xia\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\nPrerequisites\nYou must complete ALL prerequisites listed in order to enroll in these courses.\nQTM 210\n\t\u2022\tEither QTM 120 or MATH 210 or MATH 211\nQTM 220\n\t\u2022\tQTM 110\n\t\u2022\tQTM 150\n\t\u2022\tQTM 210 or ECON 220 or MATH 361 with a plan to co-enroll in MATH 362\n\t\u2022\tMATH 210 or MATH 211\n\t\u2022\tMATH 221\nElective Prerequisites\n\t\u2022\tQTM 385 prerequisites will be listed in the course description!!!\n\u00a0\nEquivalents\nBelow are courses that act as equivalents to the respective QTM courses\nQTM 210:\n\t\u2022\tECON 220 and [MATH 210 or MATH 211]\n\t\u2022\tOR - MATH 362\nQTM 220:\n\t\u2022\tECON 320 plus QTM 110, QTM 150, MATH 221 and [MATH 210 or MATH 211]\n\u00a0\nFor General Academic Advising\nSchedule an appointment at\u00a0https://calendly.com/emoryqtm.\n\u00a0\nIf you have any questions regarding the above information, please do not hesitate to reach out.\n\u00a0\nBest,\nSadie Hannans\nQTM Program Coordinator\nShanna9@emory.edu\u00a0\u00a0 470-620-7981\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nQTM Preparation: A Pathway to Professionalism\n\u00a0\nNew Resources Available\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Getting Started with SQL\n\n\u00a0\nGit and GitHub\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nQTM DataCamp Access\nQTM Access to DataCamp is now back in business!

JO GULDI\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nQTM 490R: Research Lab\n\u201cUsing AI to Assess the Documentary History of Climate Change: A Multidisciplinary Approach\u201d\n\u00a0\nAs carbon and methane emissions shape our shared future, one essential question is how organizations, institutions, and markets are adopting or failing to adopt new regulations and practices for carbon mitigation and adaptation. An enormous number of published texts document the regulatory life of organizations involved with climate change, including the publications the United Nations, the quarterly reports of U.S Corporations, the World Bank Reports, the Building Codes that govern city, county, and state sustainability plans, and the bills passed by nations. \n\u00a0\nTo date, few scholars have attempted to deploy AI to inspect this documentary record.\u00a0 As a result, we have little insight into the successes, failures, and promise of initiatives represented by this documentary base. Research in Computer Science by specialists in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the Digital Humanities (DH), however, hold promising keys for moving from large language models to accurate depictions of historical change in the recent past.\n\u00a0\nOur research will apply these new methods to understanding contemporary institutions. We will connect modern white-box methods from Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Digital Humanities (DH) to the data of climate change governance, illuminating the history of official promises and regulation attempts, and allowing researchers to assemble a timeline and critical account of how climate governance has been changing over the past five, ten, and twenty years.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nWhat will the course be like? In a research lab, we don\u2019t have a set syllabus as in a seminar or lecture series.

We have an exhibition at the end of semester where we display student artwork and encourage the rest of the Emory community to be scientifically and artistically engaged in various topics. In the past, our artists have drawn inspiration from research in biology chemistry, psychology, sociology, physics, political science, and many more fields.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI am writing to you with the hope of connecting with student researchers in your department who might be keen on sharing their research projects or articles with our club and be paired up with artists who can take their research forward in a creative way.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Submitted by Ariya Maskara\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\nPrerequisites\nYou must complete ALL prerequisites listed in order to enroll in these courses.\nQTM 210\n\t\u2022\tEither QTM 120 or MATH 210 or MATH 211\nQTM 220\n\t\u2022\tQTM 110\n\t\u2022\tQTM 150\n\t\u2022\tQTM 210 or ECON 220 or MATH 361 with a plan to co-enroll in MATH 362\n\t\u2022\tMATH 210 or MATH 211\n\t\u2022\tMATH 221\nElective Prerequisites\n\t\u2022\tQTM 385 prerequisites will be listed in the course description!!!\n\u00a0\nEquivalents\nBelow are courses that act as equivalents to the respective QTM courses\nQTM 210:\n\t\u2022\tECON 220 and [MATH 210 or MATH 211]\n\t\u2022\tOR - MATH 362\nQTM 220:\n\t\u2022\tECON 320 plus QTM 110, QTM 150, MATH 221 and [MATH 210 or MATH 211]\n\u00a0\nFor General Academic Advising\nSchedule an appointment at\u00a0https://calendly.com/emoryqtm.\n\u00a0\nIf you have any questions regarding the above information, please do not hesitate to reach out.\n\u00a0\nBest,\nSadie Hannans\nQTM Program Coordinator\nShanna9@emory.edu\u00a0\u00a0 470-620-7981\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nQTM Preparation: A Pathway to Professionalism\n\u00a0\nNew Resources Available\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Getting Started with SQL\n\n\u00a0\nGit and GitHub\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nQTM DataCamp Access\nQTM Access to DataCamp is now back in business!
