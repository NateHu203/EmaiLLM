Hi, Emory! 
This week’s issue is a buffet of news. Meet the 2022 Emory grad who won a highly competitive Pickering Fellow award, learn more about new research focusing on the LGBTQ+ experience in the South, get to know the inaugural director of the Center for AI Learning and more. We’re also digging into the racial climate survey results about campus experiences. 
Oh, and hear from two alumni who lead New York City's Office of Chief Medical Examiner. We’re not saying that it's like a realistic “CSI” episode ... but we're not not saying that, either. 
Have a great rest of your week, Eagles!

Police officers and traffic flaggers will assist motorists in moving safely around the closures. Campus Services officials ask that those who use Clifton Road and Haygood Drive plan for traffic delays and avoid the area if possible.

Hi, Eagles! 
Today, we’re celebrating outstanding students across the university.
Friday was Match Day, when students in School of Medicine Class of 2025 discovered where they’ll continue their medical training. The swimming and diving teams competed in the NCAA Division III tournament last weekend, where the men claimed runner-up and women placed fifth.
And right now, a contingent of undergraduate and graduate Emory students is attending the World Health Organization’s Global Conference on Air Pollution and Health.
Here on campus, we’ve got the scoop on Dooley’s Week, the expansion of visual arts, a wellness event and more.
We’ll see you next week, Eagles!
